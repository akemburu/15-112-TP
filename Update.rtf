\f0\fs24 \cf0 Update: I have shifted gears on my project from mood detection, to detecting whether a user is asleep or awake. The two variables I am using to gauge and classify whether a user is awake or asleep are the size of the open eye and the size of the open mouth. Using binary thresholding, masking, and histogram equalizing I have been able to calculate the number of pixels of the white area and pupil of an eye and the dark pixels  of a mouth which signify an open mouth. My KNN algorithm has been written, however I am still trying to implement with a more thorough dataset (i need more points). I have some of my UI/UX completed as well transitioning from screen to screen. This version, however, does not display the classification on the final screen, but I will finish this portion before the end of the night. This version of my project is very buggy however because openCV needs certain conditions to produce the proper results. }
